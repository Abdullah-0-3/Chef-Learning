# Chef Learning Practices

Assalam-o-Alikyum!

I hope you are doing well. I am <b>Muhammad Abdullah Abrar</b> on a journey to become a <b>DevOps Enginner</b>.

These are some fo my practices when I was learning Chef. I enjoy documenting and sharing knowledge. If you want to use it then you have to clone and use it in Linux or most probably Windows.
